This is the source code for a two-dimensional two-phase finite volume Euler solver (polar coordinate system, polar axisymmetry). It was developed as a test bed for the non-linear acoustic approximation artificial boundary condition. Details of the method can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2014.12.037

If you are looking at this you have probably also been looking at my Ph.D. thesis.

Brief further details of running the code are given in the DOCUMENTATION folder.

TO DO:

Tidy up!
